            <p>The IOC Search is designed help locate Indicators of Compromise (IPs, domains, email addresses, hashes). </p>
            <p>In order to use this you should understand what you can and cannot search. </p>
            <p>For example you can use this to search for individual search terms -- based on <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Search/Eventsegmentationandsearching#Minor_breakers">Minor Breakers</a> and <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Search/Eventsegmentationandsearching#Major_breakers">Major Breakers</a>. You can only search terms which contain Minor Breakers. All terms are split with Major Breakers.</p>
<p>You can also use wildcards with the IOC Search. For example if you wanted to search IPs in this range 10.5.1.0/24 which could be searched with this <code>10.5.1.*</code></p>

<h1>Major breakers</h1>
<p>Major breakers are a set of characters that are used to divide words, phrases, or terms in the event data into large tokens. Examples of major breakers are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>A space</li>
<li>A newline</li>
<li>A tab</li>
<li>Angle brackets &#x003C; &#x003E;</li>
<li>Square brackets [ ]</li>
<li>Parenthesis ( )</li>
<li>Curly brackets { }</li>
<li>An exclamation point  !</li>
<li>A question mark  ?</li>
<li>A semicolon ;</li>
<li>A comma ,</li>
<li>Single and double quotation marks ' "</li>
<li>The ampersand sign &#x0026;</li>
<li>There are also multiple major breakers that use percent-encoding, primarily for reserved characters. These major breakers begin with a percent symbol followed by a code. For example, %21 is the code for the exclamation point ( ! ) character and %2526 is a double encoded ampersand ( &#x0026;&#x0026; ).</li>
</ul>
